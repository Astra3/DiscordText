# Discord Text Edits

This python script allows you to do basic edits for input text
shown here:
* emojify - aka replaces chars with their emoji counterparts
* reverse - reverses text
* spoielr - puts chars into double vertical bars, effectively making every char as a spoiler in Discord
* varied - varies the case in text

## Examples
Because similar effects can be achieved in markdown, here are examples:

|Edit | Result|
